# PolitiVue

PolitiVue is a simple app that displays local and federal government officials, 
their party affiliation, contact information, social media accounts, and where 
their offices are located.

## What is the Purpose of This App?

We recognize that there are other websites and services out there that can 
return this same data, but we aimed to bring all of that data that is scattered 
around the internet and display it in a clear and simple way. 

## The App in Action

We have built a simple account creation tool that stores the user's name, email,
zip code, and a password that is validated and encrypted.

The only input required by the user is their zip code.

The list of government officials are the user's representatives for their area.
Clicking on an official displays more information about them on the right.
