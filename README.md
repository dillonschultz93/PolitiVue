PolitiVue is a simple app that displays local and federal government officials, 
their party affiliation, contact information, social media accounts, and where 
their offices are located.

## What is the purpose of this app?

We recognize that there are other websites and services out there that can 
return this same data, but we aimed to bring all of that data that is scattered 
around the internet and display it in a clear and simple way. 

## Installing

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
